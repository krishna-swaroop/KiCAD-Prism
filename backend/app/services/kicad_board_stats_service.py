"""Board facts from ``kicad-cli``, not from a parser of our own.

Prism used to derive the board outline size by scanning the ``.kicad_pcb``
itself: every ``gr_line``/``gr_arc``/``gr_poly``/``gr_circle`` block was pulled
out and the Edge.Cuts ones reduced to a bounding box. That was wrong twice
over.

It was wrong in principle, because Release Studio already states the rule this
module follows -- KiCad owns the board-statistics schema (see
``app/release_studio/projections.py``). A second, hand-written parser for the
same facts can only ever be an approximation of the first, and it silently
disagreed with KiCad on arc bulge, which the scan approximated by its endpoints
and midpoint.

It was wrong in practice, because the scan was quadratic. It sliced the tail of
the file on every match, so a 57.7 MB board with 10,217 ``gr_line`` blocks
copied roughly 400 GB of string, saturated a core, and -- being pure Python
under the GIL -- starved the event loop serving every other request on the
box. That is what made opening a large project take tens of seconds.

``kicad-cli pcb export stats`` answers the same question authoritatively in
about 30 seconds on that board. Thirty seconds is still far too long to spend
inside a request, which is why nothing here is called from one: the metadata
job runs this once when a project is imported or synced, and the API serves
what it stored.
